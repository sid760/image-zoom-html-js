It will contain an image (of your choice) and a range component.

We need to zoom (in or out) the image based on the selection of the range component as shown below. If you select the range value right from the middle it will zoom in the image. Similarly, if you select the left side values it will zoom out the image. In the middle value the image will stay in its normal size.
